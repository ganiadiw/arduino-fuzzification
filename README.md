## Arduino Temperature and Humidity Fuzzification

Fuzzy logic with microcontroller device to determine of watering time for plants based on temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor.

The DHT11 sensor is a sensor module that function to sense temperature and humidity which has an analog voltage output that can be further processed using a microcontroller.

In this project I use the NodeMCU esp32 microcontroller.

#### Project Requirements :
> 1. Whatever microcontroller what you have
> 2. DHT11 sensor module
> 3. Web server to run php program
> 4. Database to save data from microcontroller

#### How to use?
> 1. Configure the database
> 2. Configure the database connection in the php file
> 3. Configure the local area network connection (IP Address and SSID) in arduino program
> 4. Configure DHT11 pin connection to microcontroller
> 5. Upload the microcontroller program to the microcontroller device
